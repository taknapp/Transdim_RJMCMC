Files required to produce samples for arXiv:2507.08095

The organization of both folders is for ease in downloading and running the associated scripts. If there are script redundancies, it is such that each folder may be downloaded and run independently. 

## Section V

Files in this folder pertain to the injections and recoveries showcased in Sec. V of the relevant manuscript. 

There is no necessary environment to run these scripts but you will need to pull `git@github.com:meyers-academic/astrophysical_gwb.git`.

To run the sampler in frequency space, please run `tsf_fitter.py`. The output is a `{sig_type}_signal_data_{T/(24 * 60 * 60)}_{noise}_spline.pkl` file that includes the injected frequencies, data, and noise as well as the results object for the fitter. 

## Section VI

Files in this folder pertain to the hierarchical injections and recoveries showcased in Sec. VI of the relevant manuscript.

You will need an environment to run these scripts. Install with `conda env create -f env.yml` This will install all the latest dependencies, from the correct place, so that `popstock` will work with JAX (from the `meyers-academic` fork and `jax` branch), and the newest version of `westley` is installed for parallel tempering.

To run the hierarchical sampler, please run the `run_hierarchical_analysis.py` script in the `westley_fitter` environment created above. The `run_hierarchical_analysis.py` saves three files as outputs: 
1. `tmp_jax_machinery.pkl` : Includes the injected signals and parameters as well as starting knot locations in the frequency space. These quantities and objects are useful for computations using the sampler results or if one wishes to resample using the same starting injections. 
2. `tmp_jax_results_{N_samples}.pkl` : Includes the results object from the sampling. This encapsulates the posterior information in the redshift space. The posteriors are plotted in Fig. 8a.
3. `tmp_jax_omegas_{N_samples}.pkl` : Includes the computed Omega(f) draws computed from each of the redshift space posteriors. These computed profiles are plotted in Fig. 8b.
